  - Added "DEFAULT__MOD" (the modifier "default" for interface method declarations).

Version 1.2.9 (2016-02-07):
  - The fix in version 1.2.7 is now obsolete, because the missing anonymous class .class file were only SEEMINGLY the
    reason for the problem.
  - WrapMethod: Parameter wrapping was not checked properly.
  - Alignment: The "case group alignment check" now applies not only to "case:" groups, but also to the "default:"
    group.
  - Whitespace: The name of an "inferred lambda parameter" is now a Java element of its own ("NAME__INFERRED_PARAM"),
    because the "whitespace before" rule must distinguish between the two.

Version 1.2.8 (2016-01-18):
  - PDE uses a different classpath than ECLIPSE - hence garnishes the class files with "Unresolved compilation
    problem"s.

  - de.unkrig.Whitespace: "(R|L)_ANGLE__TYPE_PARAMS" didn't work (typo).
  - Moved "de.unkrig.doclet.cs.jar" from the CORE project to the DIST project, so it doesn't get packaged with the
    plug-in.

Version 1.2.1 (2015-07-29):
  - Re-introduced the "<message-key>"s for the rules.

Version 1.2.0 (2015-07-28):
  - WrapAndIndent: Property 'wrapArrayInitBeforeLCurly' now also applies to ANNOTATION array initializers.
  - WrapAndIndent: Not only array initializers, method calls and enum definitions may have MUTIPLE values in one line,
    but now also ANNOTATION array initializers.
  - German localization of quickfix labels and descriptions was missing.
  - Check documentation (generated automatically by cs-doclet and translated manually into german) now includes the
    relevant quickfixes.
  - Replaced "WrapAndIndent" with 15 new checks named "Wrap...Check", because "WrapAndIndent" had way too many
    parameters.

  - All meta files and online documentation is now generated wit "cs-doclet".
  - Added german localization.

  - WrapAndIndent: Added the 'wrapPackageDeclBeforePackage' option.

Version 1.0.18 (2014-04-10):

  - AstUtil.toJavaElement(): Angle brackets: Type arguments were falsely identified as method invocation type arguments
    if the type was QUALIFIED (e.g. "Map.Entry<...>").

Version 1.0.13 (2013-12-02):
  - 'AbstractDocumentResolution' now parses the message's arguments.
  - quickfixes/WrapAndIndent3: '{0} must appear in column {1} not {2}' is now corretly fixed.

Version 1.0.12 (2013-12-01):
  - Removed 'whitespaceBefore / void', because 'void.class' may legally appear with preceding whitespace.
  - WrapAndIndent: Check wrapping before and after binary operators.
  - WrapAndIndent: Array index operations were not properly checked.
  - WrapAndIndent: 'Object[].class' crashed the expression wrapping check.

  - WrapAndIndent: Whether declarations must/must not be wrapped (ClassDeclBeforeClass, InterfaceDeclBeforeInterface,
    EnumDeclBeforeEnum, AnnoDeclBeforeAt, FieldDeclBeforeName, CtorDeclBeforeName, MethDeclBeforeName,
    LocVarDeclBeforeName) is now configurable.      
  - WrapAndIndent: Whether one must/must not wrap before lcurly (TypeDecl, CtorDecl, MethodDecl, Do, ArrayInit,
    AnonClassDecl) is now configurable.
